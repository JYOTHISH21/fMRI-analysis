# fMRI-analysis

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the small changes in blood flow that occur with brain activity. It may be used to examine which parts of the brain are handling critical functions, evaluate the effects of stroke or other disease, or to guide brain treatment.

This project includes the use of Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II) data to classify indviduals based on whether they are on the category of Autism Spectrum Disorders(ASD) or not

The fmri.ipynb file does classification on entire dataset The male.ipynb file does classification on male subjects in dataset The female.ipynb file does classification on female subjects in dataset The U13.ipynb file does classification on subjects under 13 in dataset The O13.ipynb file does classification on subjects over 13 in dataset
